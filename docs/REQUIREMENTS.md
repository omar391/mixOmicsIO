# Requirements Analysis: `mixOmicsIO`

## 1. Project Vision

To create a seamless and intuitive bridge between the `mixOmics` data structures and the widely-used `SummarizedExperiment` and `MultiAssayExperiment` objects from Bioconductor. This will enhance interoperability within the bioinformatics ecosystem and lower the barrier to entry for researchers already using Bioconductor standards.

## 2. User Profile

- **Primary:** Bioinformaticians and computational biologists who use Bioconductor for upstream data processing and wish to apply `mixOmics` for multivariate analysis.
- **Secondary:** Researchers who receive data in `SummarizedExperiment` format and want to use `mixOmics` without complex data wrangling.

## 3. Functional Requirements (MVP)

- **FR1: `SummarizedExperiment` to `mixOmics` Conversion:** The package MUST provide a function to convert a `SummarizedExperiment` object into a list of data matrices (`X`, `Y`) and metadata suitable for `mixOmics` functions.
- **FR2: `mixOmics` to `SummarizedExperiment` Conversion:** The package MUST provide a function to convert `mixOmics` results (e.g., from `plsda`, `block.splsda`) back into a `SummarizedExperiment` object, storing loadings and other results in the object's metadata slots.
- **FR3: Metadata Integrity:** The conversion process MUST preserve sample and feature metadata (e.g., `colData`, `rowData`).
- **FR4: Assay Selection:** For `SummarizedExperiment` objects with multiple assays, the user MUST be able to specify which assay to use for the conversion.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1: Documentation:** The package must have a `README.md` with clear installation instructions and a basic usage example.
- **NFR2: Testing:** The package must include unit tests for all core conversion functions to ensure correctness.
- **NFR3: Dependencies:** The package should minimize new dependencies, primarily relying on `mixOmics` and `SummarizedExperiment`.

## 5. Future Scope (Post-MVP)

- **FS1: `MultiAssayExperiment` Support:** Extend conversion functions to handle `MultiAssayExperiment` objects for multi-omics data integration.
- **FS2: S4 Methods:** Implement formal S4 methods for a more elegant and robust user interface.
- **FS3: Vignette:** Write a detailed vignette showcasing a complete workflow, from a raw `SummarizedExperiment` to a `mixOmics` analysis and back.
