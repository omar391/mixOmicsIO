# Task List: Article 1

## Week 3

- [ ] **Task 1: Write the First Draft:** Focus on getting the story and all the key narrative points down. Don't worry about perfect prose. Follow the outline.
- [ ] **Task 2: Develop Code Snippets:** Create clean, easy-to-read code examples using `mixOmicsIO` that perfectly illustrate the package's utility.
- [ ] **Task 3: Create Visuals:** Create one or two simple diagrams. For example, a "Before" diagram showing messy data conversion and an "After" diagram showing the clean `mixOmicsIO` workflow.
- [ ] **Task 4: Refine and Edit:** Read the draft aloud. Check for flow, clarity, and tone. Ensure it sounds like a confident, competent expert.
- [ ] **Task 5: Get Feedback:** Ask a colleague or friend (ideally from a different field) to read it to ensure the analogy is clear and the story is compelling.
- [ ] **Task 6: Publish on Medium:** Publish the article. Make sure to use relevant tags (e.g., #Bioinformatics, #RStats, #SoftwareDevelopment, #CareerChange).
- [ ] **Task 7: Promote the Article:** Share the article on LinkedIn and Twitter, tagging the LÃª Cao Lab or `mixOmics` if appropriate and you feel confident.
